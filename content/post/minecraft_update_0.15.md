I love Minecraft. Yesterday there was an update (0.15) that was really cool.

They added horses and a lead so you can walk your horse. They also added fire charge which makes a cool fire. Texture packs have also been added and my favourite is called Plastic Texture Pack. But I haven't got it yet because you have to pay for it.
