Nanny and Poppy took me and my sister to the Royal Show.

My favourite showbag was the Zelf bag. I loved the different flavoured milk - my favourite was choc mint. We had to spin the wheel and my sister and I won yoghurt and I won a cow backpack.

My favourite animal in the petting zoo was the beautiful soft black rabbit. I had a camel ride, went on the dragon wagon and the ferris wheel at night. We had dinner and I had a small burger and chips and then we watched the fire works.
